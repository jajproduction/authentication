I used this template for my projects. You can delete this file and change it to yours.

- [x] TypeScript
- [x] ShadCN
- [x] Prisma
- [x] Bcryptjs
- [x] Axios

Run the following:

```shell
npm install
rm README.md
```

**Note:** All the files that contain `authentication` should be renamed to your project name.
